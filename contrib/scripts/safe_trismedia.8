.SH NAME
.B safe_trismedia
\(em A wrapper to run the trismedia executable in a loop
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP 
.B safe_trismedia
.I [ trismedia_params ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B safe_trismedia 
is a script that runs trismedia in a loop, which can be useful if you 
fear trismedia may crash.

The script does not run in the background like a standard service. Rather, 
it runs in its own linux virtual console (9, by default).
It also uses the option '-c' of trismedia(8) to avoid detaching trismedia 
from that terminal.

safe_trismedia also runs trismedia with unlimited core file size, and thus 
trismedia will dump core in case of a crash.

To get a "picture" of console 9, from another terminal (e.g: from a 
remote shell session) you can use:

  screendump 9

The init script of the Debian package should be able to run safe_trismedia 
as the trismedia service, if so configured. See coments in 
/etc/default/trismedia

.SH FILES
.B /tmp
.RS
safe_trismedia runs in that directory, rather than in / as usual.
.RE

.B /tmp/core
.RS
If core files were generated there, they may be 
.RE

.B /etc/trismedia/startup.d
.RS
Files in this directory will be 'source'd by the safe_trismedia script before
it starts Trismedia proper, allowing them to set additional environment variables
or run any other steps that are needed for your system.
.RE

.SH BUGS
While showing the output on a console is useful, using screen(1) as 
the terminal may be better.

The script does not read configuration from standard location under /etc

It uses fixed locations under /tmp , and thus may be exposed to a 
symlink attacks.
